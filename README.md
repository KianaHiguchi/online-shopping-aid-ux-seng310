# Online Shopping Aid UX Prototype - SENG 310

A SENG 310 (Human-Computer Interaction) UX design project focused on improving trust and transparency in online shopping. The interface concept helps users verify authenticity and evaluate ethical/sustainability factors without leaving the shopping platform.

## Overview
This project was completed for SENG 310 as part of a 5-person team. We explored how a UI can reduce dropshipping scams, copied designs, and misleading product listings. The work emphasizes research, knowledge of design heuristics, and iterative prototyping. I contributed a majority of design/prototype work across deliverables, and led project coordination.

## Notes
This repository is intended to showcase the project evolution of a UX-centered prototype and problem proposal
