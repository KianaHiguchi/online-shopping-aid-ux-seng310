# Online Shopping Aid UX Prototype - SENG 310

A SENG 310 (Human-Computer Interaction) UX design project focused on improving trust and transparency in online shopping. The interface concept helps users verify authenticity and evaluate ethical/sustainability factors without leaving the shopping platform.

## Overview
This project was completed for SENG 310 as part of a 5-person team. We explored how a UI can reduce dropshipping scams, copied designs, and misleading product listings. The work emphasizes research, knowledge of design heuristics, and iterative prototyping. I contributed a majority of design/prototype work across deliverables and led project coordination.

## Design Process

### Problem Framing 
We began by framing the problem around trust, transparency, and decision fatigue in online shopping. Through interviews and ethnographic observation, we identified recurring user pain points: difficulty verifying product authenticity, uncertainty around ethical and sustainability claims, time-consuming price comparisons, and distrust caused by poor UI patterns (e.g., fake urgency, overloaded pages). Research showed that while users care about ethics and sustainability, they often lack the time or tools to verify claims and must balance these concerns against price sensitivity. These findings informed a design goal of centralizing verification, comparison, and trust cues into a single, streamlined interface that minimizes cognitive load and reduces fragmented research.

### Low-Fidelity Exploration
Low-fidelity exploration focused on ideation, feature selection, and task flow, rather than visual appeal. Each team member produced multiple hand-drawn sketches, supported by structured brainstorming techniques including wild ideation and a functions–means tree. This process allowed us to explore a wide solution space and systematically evaluate how different features could support user goals. Role-playing and flow mapping were used to test early navigation concepts and ensure logical progression through tasks. From this stage, five core features were selected: product authenticity verification, sustainability assessment, ethical labor assessment, price comparison, and trust/scam detection. A low-fidelity prototype was built in PowerPoint that could be manually walked through. It emphasized layout structure, information hierarchy, and how features could be cohesively integrated.

### Mid-High Fidelity Iteration 
The mid-fidelity prototype was implemented in Figma as a clickable, interactive walkthrough that refined layout, navigation, and feedback mechanisms identified as weak during heuristic evaluation. This iteration introduced clearer system status indicators, back/undo controls, structured result layouts, and a unified URL-based entry point to reduce user confusion. Although referred to as “mid-fidelity” in the course, this version functioned as the most complete and testable prototype and was used for heuristic evaluation and user testing. Feedback from these evaluations informed further refinements, including improved discoverability, clearer affordances, reduced visual overload, and better alignment with user expectations. The iterative process demonstrated how research findings, heuristic analysis, and user feedback directly shaped design decisions. Many features had fully functional flows and user interface elements.
